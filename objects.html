      // the constructor  even if method was added AFTER instance was created

      // Advantage: The instance automatically updates so we don't have to keep track of when a method was added vs creation of instance

      // NOTE: Do not return object {} in constructor because the object has no reference to the Constructor (like anonymous function)
      // Assign methods to "this" keyword inside constructor
